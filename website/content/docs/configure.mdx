  There are various ways to configure Packer. You can not set anything an Packer
  will use known folders, or you can change things using environment variables.

# Configuring Packer

-> **Note:** There are a few configuration settings that affect Packer globally
by configuring the core of Packer. These settings all have reasonable defaults,
so you generally don't have to worry about it until you want to tweak a
configuration. If you're just getting started with Packer, don't worry about
core configuration for now.

# Packer's home directory

Plugins and core configuration files can exist in the home directory of
Packer. The home directory of packer will be the first one of the following
values to be set:

| unix                   | windows               |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| `${PACKER_CONFIG_DIR}` | `%PACKER_CONFIG_DIR%` |
| `${APPDATA}`           | `%APPDATA%`           |
| `${HOME}`              | `%HOME%`              |
| user dir of `${USER}`  | user dir of `${USER}` |

-> Note: On this page this directory will be referenced as the
 `PACKER_HOME_DIR` env variable.

# Packer's plugin directory

@include "plugins/plugin-location.mdx"

# Packer's config file

The first value set of the following list will be parsed as the config file, it
is not an error if no config file was found :

| unix                               | windows                           |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `${PACKER_CONFIG}`                 | `%PACKER_CONFIG%`                 |
| `${PACKER_HOME_DIR}/.packerconfig` | `%PACKER_HOME_DIR%/.packerconfig` |

-> Note: On this page, `PACKER_HOME_DIR` is the [Packer's home
directory](#packer-s-home-directory).

The format of the configuration file is basic JSON.

## Packer config file configuration Reference

Below is the list of all available configuration parameters for the core
configuration file. None of these are required, since all have defaults.

- `plugin_min_port` and `plugin_max_port` (number) - These are the minimum
  and maximum ports that Packer uses for communication with plugins, since
  plugin communication happens over TCP connections on your local host. By
  default these are 10,000 and 25,000, respectively. Be sure to set a fairly
  wide range here, since Packer can easily use over 25 ports on a single run.

- `builders`, `commands`, `post-processors`, and `provisioners` are objects
  that are used to install plugins. The details of how exactly these are set is
  covered in more detail in the [installing plugins documentation
  page](/docs/extending/plugins). It is recommend to use [HCL2
  `required_plugins`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/blocks/packer#specifying-plugin-requirements)
  and the [`packer init`](/docs/commands/init) command to install plugins.
