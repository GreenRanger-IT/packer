* [`packer init`](/commands/init) will install plugins in the last directory set
-- that is, where the used variable is set -- in the following list.

* During the initialization of Packer, any **required** plugin will be looked up
in all entries of the following list; in the fully addressable place it is
expected to be, for example:
`${PACKER_HOME_DIR}/plugins/github.com/azr/amazon/packer-plugin-amazon_v0.0.6_darwin_amd64_x5`. 
First plugin found takes precedence.

1. The directory where `packer` is, or the executable directory.
1. The current working directory. (`"."`)
1. The `PACKER_HOME_DIR/plugins` directory. PACKER_HOME_DIR refers to *[Packer's home 
directory](/docs/configure#packer-s-home-directory)*, if it could be found.
1. The director(y/ies) under the `PACKER_PLUGIN_PATH` env var, if `PACKER_PLUGIN_PATH`
is set.

~> **Note**: There can be more than one directory in the `PACKER_PLUGIN_PATH`
env var, it will be seperated by a semicolon (`;`) on Windows systems and a
colon (`:`) on other systems. The last one found will be the one used.
